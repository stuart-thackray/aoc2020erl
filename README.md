# Advent of Code 2020 with Erlang


Will continue whilst I have time find it interesting. Don't expect optimized; try but when works then stop.

1. Day2 :heavy_check_mark:
1. Day3 :heavy_check_mark:
1. Day4 :heavy_check_mark:
1. Day5 :heavy_check_mark:
1. Day6 :heavy_check_mark:
1. Day7 :x: Took way too much time parsing the input; had attempt at rules; but couldn't get to work; guess gb_trees or another way correct way of getting answer.
*edit* :heavy_check_mark: part one   :x: p2 didn't try was taking too much time; with silly issues of p1; and not following correct way which i think gb_trees or diagraph
1. Day8 :heavy_check_mark: start seq from 0 ftw
1. Day9 :heavy_check_mark:
1. Day10 :heavy_check_mark: part 1 :x: wasn't able to figure out p2 (might revisit)
1. Day11 :heavy_check_mark:
1. Day12 :x: doesn't work; to much maths
1. Day13 part1 :heavy_check_mark: part2 :x:
1. Day14 :heavy_check_mark:
1. Day15 part1 :heavy_check_mark: part2 still running (rotfl) :x:
1. Day16 part1 :heavy_check_mark: part2 couldn't figure out the rules tried numerous ways neither seemed to work :x: 
1. Day17 think have idea on solution here; but haven't done it. 
1. Day18 *skipped*






Based on what I can rember from https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUqzFB27iPEQllqaYUp5dVw/videos
