# Advent of Code 2020 with Erlang


Will continue whilst I have time find it interesting. Don't expect optimized; try but when works then stop.

1. Day7 :x: Took way too much time parsing the input; had attempt at rules; but couldn't get to work; guess gb_trees or another way correct way of getting answer.
*edit* :heavy_check_mark: part one   :x: p2 didn't try was taking too much time; with silly issues of p1; and not following correct way which i think gb_trees or diagraph
1. Day8 :heavy_check_mark: start seq from 0 ftw







Based on what I can rember from https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUqzFB27iPEQllqaYUp5dVw/videos
